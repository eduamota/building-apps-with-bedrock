Demo 1: Basic RAG with Bedrock Knowledge Bases
Pattern: Fully Managed RAG (Travel Expense Policy)

S3 documents → Bedrock KB → Aurora pgvector → Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Simple retrieve_and_generate() API

Demo 2: Cost-Effective RAG with S3 Vectors ⭐ NEW
Pattern: S3 Native Vector Storage (90% cheaper than traditional vector DBs)

Direct S3 vector bucket with native indexing

boto3 s3vectors client for insert/query operations

Titan Embeddings → S3 vector index → Claude generation

Cost: ~$11/month for 10M vectors vs $100-200/month for managed DBs

Key Learning: Perfect for cost-sensitive, large-scale RAG applications

Demo 3: Hybrid Search RAG (Vector + Keyword)
Pattern: Advanced Retrieval with Dual Search

pgvector cosine similarity + PostgreSQL full-text search

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merging

Query transformation

Demo 4: RAG with Re-ranking Pipeline
Pattern: Advanced Modular RAG with Quality Improvement

Initial retrieval (top 20) → Re-ranker (top 5) → Generation

SageMaker re-ranking model

Relevance scoring

Demo 5: Multi-Collection RAG with Metadata Filtering
Pattern: Enterprise RAG with Collections

Collection routing (Technical Docs, FAQs, Memos)

Metadata-based filtering

Collection-specific prompts
